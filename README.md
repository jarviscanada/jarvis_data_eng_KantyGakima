**Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KantyGakima.git/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a distributed monitoring agent using Bash/shell scripts to capture hardware specifications and real-time resource metrics across multiple hosts. Deployed a docker containerized PostgreSQL database to store the collected data and automated the ingestion using crontab. The solution provides continuous, minute-level data collection suitable for data analytics, performance monitoring and maintenance.
