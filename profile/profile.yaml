summary: >
  Computer Science graduate from Université de Montréal with  hands-on experience in software development, data processing, and building data-driven tools.
  Currently working as a Data Engineer at Jarvis, where I design and implement data workflows, automation scripts, and backend components using Python, SQL, Java, Bash, Docker, and Linux-based tooling.
  I work within an Agile/Scrum environment, collaborating with the team to deliver reliable, well-structured solutions. I have developed a strong foundation in data modelling,
  pipeline development, and efficient problem-solving. Eager to apply my skills in data engineering, analytics, or related fields while continuing to grow my expertise.

    description: >
      Implemented a monitoring system using Bash/Shell scripts and Linux utilities to collect hardware specifications and real-time usage metrics from multiple Linux hosts. 
      Deployed a Docker-containerized PostgreSQL database to store collected data and automated continuous data ingestion using crontab. 
      The system provides a centralized and reliable data pipeline for performance monitoring, analytics, and maintenance.

  - name: "Python Data Analytics - London Gift Shop(LGS) Proof of Concept"
    git_url: "/python_data_analytics"
    description: >
      Designed and delivered a proof-of-concept analytics solution to help an e-commerce retailer understand customer purchasing 
      behaviour and improve revenue strategy. Loaded a historical SQL export into a Dockerized PostgreSQL database, cleaned and
      analyzed the data using Python, Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook. Genrated insights on seasonal trends, 
      customer retention, cancellation patterns, Geographic concentration  and RFM-based segmentation, providing actionable recommendations for targeted 
      marketing strategies

  - name: "Java Grep App"
    git_url: "/core_java"
    description: >
      Developed a Java command-line application that recursively searches files ina directory for lines matching a user defined
      regular expression and writes all matching to an output file, similar to `egrep -r`. Implemented file traversal, regex pattern
      matching and efficient file I/O using Java streams. Packaged the application as both a runnable JAR and a docker image.

    description: >
      Developed a full-stack web application that helps users store all their favourite recipes in one place and keep them easily accessible.
      The app allows any user to add, edit, and delete their own recipes, with updates appearing in real time for everyone. Built using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript,
      HTML, CSS, and supported by a simple REST API with asynchronous fetch requests to handle all CRUD operations and keep the interface in sync.rt CRUD operations
      and instant synchronization.

  - name: "Travel reservation system"
    description: >
      Developed a Java-based reservation system centered on structured data modelling and system logic. Designed core components using object-oriented principles and UML diagrams in Visual Paradigm,
      implemented reservation workflows, and validated functionality with JUnit tests. The project focused on clean data structures, reliable application logic, and maintainable code aligned with software engineering best practices.
